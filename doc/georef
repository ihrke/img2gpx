1.  Are the two coordinate system's axes' orthogonal to each other -
that is, do their own axes remain perpendicular when viewed through
either coordinate system?

For example,  a Lat/Lon graticule can be superimposed upon a Mercator
or Miller Map Projection, which are cylindrical projections, so that
the axes remain orthogonal.  However, the Transverse Mercator or any
other oblique Mercator, also cylindrical projections, would not be
considered orthogonal, as the axis of these projections, when super-
imposed upon a graticule of straight Lat/Lon lines become quite
curved.

A conical map projection (such as a Lambert), or various map projections
allowing extremely oblique views, say, as taken from satellites, would
not map very well at all to cylindrical map projections or the above
mentioned graticule, using 3 registration coordinates, or perhaps even
using only a 6 parameter solution.

2.  How large is the area of coverage?

For fairly small areas of coverage, whether or not the systems are
orthogonal, you might get by with a fairly simple 6 parameter solution
which only requires 3-pairs of coordinates (3 tuples) to get decent
results.

For larger areas of coverage in which the systems are non-orthogonal,
you will probably need to several more pairs of registration coordinates.
These will be used to "instruct the mathematical solution" as to the
nature of the relationship between the two systems of axes or coord-
inates.  In fact, depending upon the two systems of coordinates you
select, and depending if the area of coverage is fairly large, you
may have to select a more suitable transformation equation set than
the classic 6 parameter solution discussed in most texts that intro-
duce the concept of rotation and scale or the transformation between
two surfaces.

------------------------------------

The equations I use and have used very often for registration problems,
are the classic 6 parameter solution, which is described in photogram-
metric texts as a 2 dimensional conformal affine transformation.

It is

X' = aX + bY + e
Y' = dX + eY + f

Ax = b

x1' = ax1 + by1 + e
x2' = ax2 + by2 + e
x3' = ax3 + by3 + e // to find a, b and e

y1' = cx1 + dy1 + f
y2' = cx2 + dy2 + f
y3' = cx3 + dy3 + f // to find c, d and f


	 x1 y1 1
A = x2 y2 1
	 x3 y3 1

	 y1'
b = y2'	 
	 y3'

	 c
x = d
	 f

This coefficients a, b, d, and e inherently solve the relationships
of rotation and scale (axis independent) between the two surfaces.
e and f are the translations in X and Y, respectively.  This equation
set requires a minimum of 3 sets of registration coordinates to solve,
and more than 3 sets if you are to evaluate any statistics regarding
accuracy of the resulting solution.

For larger areas of coverage, especially when the two systems being
solved are non-orthogonal, I tend to use a higher order polynomial.  One
such example is an 8 parameter:

X' = aX^2 + bXY + cY^2 + e
Y' = fX^2 + gXY + hY^2 + i

(e and i are X and Y translations respectively; the other coefficients
inherently accommodate the transformation needs for rotation and scale)

or a 12 parameter:

X' = aX^2 + bX + cXY + eY^2 + f
Y' = gX^2 + hX + iXy + kY^2 + l

or other variants - depending upon surfaces (you can use terms with
logs, sins, etc - just depends what functions best model your systems).

The 8 parameter requires a minimum of 4 registration coordinates to obtain
a mathematical solution, and the 12 parameter requires 6.

If, however, you wish to statistically evaluate the results of your
registration, based upon your control points, you need to provide, at
a minimum, one more control point than the solution's minimum requirement.

These extra control points, introducing redundancy into your measurements,
enables you to perform a least-squares analysis of your solution, which
has the added effect of minimizing the spatial error about your control
points.  You would measure statistical accuracy by:

1.  First computing the solution from the calibrated system (From system)
to the comparator system (the To System).

2.  Taking your original comparator registration coordinates, applying
the solution obtained in #1 above, and subtracting the results
(Expected - Observed).  Each of these results is known as a residual.
A check you can do here is to sum up your residuals when finished.  If
you did indeed solve the least-squares part of it correctly, the sum of
your residuals will always equal zero (0).

Compute your standard deviation from your residuals - also known as the
root mean square error (RMSE).  Compare the RMSE with the type of spatial
error you want to tolerate.  Please remember that this standard deviation
will be based upon the Normal Distribution Curve.
